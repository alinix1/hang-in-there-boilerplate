## Project Overview

### A paired project showing understanding of the connections between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Created motivational posters with the following functionality:
  - When a page loads, we should see a poster with a randomly selected image, title, and quotes
  - When a user clicks the Show Random Poster button, a new random poster is displayed
  - When a user clicks the Make You Own Poster button, we see a form, and the main poster should be hidden
  - When a user clicks the View Saved Posters button, we should see the saved posters area, and main poster will be hidden
  - When a user clicks the Nevermind, take me back! or Back to Main buttons, we should only see the main poster section
  - On the new poster form, users should be able to fill out the three input fields and then hit the Show My Poster button
  - When a user clicks the Save This Poster button, the current main poster will be added to the respective Saved Posters array
  - If a user clicks the Save This Poster button more than once on a single poster, it will only be saved once (no duplicates)
  - When a user clicks the Show Saved Posters button, we should see the saved posters section
  - All posters in Saved Posters array displayed in the saved posters grid section
